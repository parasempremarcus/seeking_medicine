Hello! It can sound strange to read a English post right after the [introdution](http://localhost:8000/introducoes/) before. However, I decide that it would be a great oportunity to begin to write in my another language to practice a little more.

That being said, welcome to the best foreigh channels I've watching lately.

### 1) Mental Outlaw

I have to thank Kenny a lot for the free knowledge regarding Linux and technology in general when I was beginning to have a good understanding of English.

In his channel, he talks about GNU/Linux, web security, programming, cryptocurrencies, and other things [like cooking](https://youtu.be/PymSsu_LufA). His videos are funny, interesting and very engaging.

My recommendation will go to [Technology's Role in the Battle Between Government and Liberty](https://youtu.be/G_eOf4uXsYY), which is one of the most appropriate way to introduce the debate between State and Liberty in a way that make effect in the life of younger people.

There's also [5 Ways Windows is Better Than Linux](https://youtu.be/72zEL9iSIXo) if you want to get something really funny.

### 2) Hakim

I'm not a Communist myself (more of that another day), however I really think it's important to listen the other side and suppose it is as rational as you. This is the why I like Hakim's videos, they are really well done, researched, and honest.

Recently, I'm trying to learn more about politics and philosophy, thanks to that interest, watching Hakim made me knew [what books I must read to understand Marxism](https://youtu.be/QdwD7zwEpZw) (and disagree with it).

His series about [race realism](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX80nwePTowtAJMoyXFjL1_PZ_flGaIDu) are very well done, I sympathize with his videos about immigrants and cringe over some dumb takes by conservative Christians on internet, like Nick Fuentes, Jews like [Ben Shapiro](https://youtu.be/E5KH-BSqqKI) and nonreligious as [Jordan Peterson](https://youtu.be/aQ3RL3WZaXg).

For him, I have some recomendations like [Former Socialism's Faults](https://youtu.be/GCv04f0RXfc), [Genetic Betrayal: The Truth About Race](https://youtu.be/pfjCVOE7l2Y) and [The Only Leftist Reading List You'll Ever Need](https://youtu.be/QdwD7zwEpZw), but the majority of his work is pretty much digestible and you can begin whenever you want.

### 3) SomeOrdinaryGamers

Another channel about technology and internet. Mutahar seems a very intelligent guy and his videos are just good to watch. He's more mainstream than Kenny, but this doesn't take the quality of his work.

My recommendation goes to [Please Stop Using Windows](https://youtu.be/d12aGhsjBlo).

### 4) Second Thought

Look at that, another Socialist channel! Well, I can't help myself, ain't I?

This one is more recent than the others and I only watched one or two of his videos. However, being friend of Hakim, Chapman has the most pretty and well edited videos on the Left that I ever come across. I bookmarked a lot of his work and, sooner or later, I will be watching it.

His [Why Would Anyone Work Under Socialism?](https://youtu.be/O9CFP_58mBc) is pretty good, but there is so much others that you can see.

### 5) Destiny

This one was a big finding for me. Destiny is a livestreamer that debate about politics while playing videogames (mostly). He's a leftist, but I agree with some considerable amount of what he says.

He's anti-abortion, polygamist, capitalist, and other things. His debates are very interesting, showing reason and changing a lot of my perspectives regarding transgender, feminism, abortion, racism, etc.

There are a lot of recommendations, I don't have time to watching his streams, but the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/destiny) has the edited version of the VODs (an archive of content previously streamed live on Twitch):

[Destiny Gets Dogpiled In HEATED 1v9 Debate Panel On Trans Sports](https://youtu.be/nPss2z6ua1Y), this is a debate that Destiny had to confront 9 participants while defending his position that transgender people should not be on their "new gender" side on sports.

[Destiny Addresses The Hasanabi 'DOXXING' Drama](https://youtu.be/tYYE76D7B0U), Hasan, even though famous, is clearly pretty dumb, and Destiny in the video talks more about it, along side [Hasan And TikTok Star Christian Walker's Agonizing Debate On Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzsyCWB-dY).

[Killstream Debate On White Genocide ft. Ethan Ralph](https://youtu.be/BWLFJBurcu4), the best of Destiny probably cames from his confrontation with racists, this one is pretty dope and extremely useful.

Last but not least, [Lauren Southern Relationship, Vaush, Dr K And Reckful - MrGirl Interviews Destiny](https://youtu.be/yhHsTX21MSQ), an very interesting conversation about human psychology between the most crazy person I ever watched, MrGirl, and Destiny.

### 6) John Campea

Cinema is one of my greatest passions, John Campea shares this passion and make livestreams (that become short videos on his channel) talking about news on the seventh art.

Campea's work is like breakfeast or lunch, I can't remember exactly what it was in the day afterwards, but I **do** know that I needed it to be moving today.

The Netflix drama is a very interesting theme recently, so [Netflix Loses A Million Subscribers But Fewer Than Expected](https://youtu.be/2j85IXkbUkw) is a good bet for something to begin.

### 7) ConnorDawg

I met Connor because of the [Trash Taste](https://www.youtube.com/c/TrashTaste), after that I realize his content is a good parallel to [Saiko](https://www.youtube.com/c/SaikoJoga), [jogandofoddaci](https://www.youtube.com/c/jogandofoddaci) or [Gemaplys](https://www.youtube.com/c/GEMAPLYS), and I really like it.

My recommendation goes to [Losing $200 Every Time I Laugh](https://youtu.be/u1YpiPWAkKc), [I'm Going To End These VTubers!](https://youtu.be/1iD5hG3-8Ko), [Showing Her The Power of Monkey!](https://youtu.be/WAqB-R1cJKg) and [Learning Japanese in 1 HOUR](https://youtu.be/AESyAH89e2o).
